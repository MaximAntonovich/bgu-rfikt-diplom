The object of research is the development of algorithm for automatic ranking and selection of most important features of the oncogene exon.

The goal of study is to develop and study algorithms for automatic selection of the most important features of exons and algorithms for cluster analysis of oncogene exons.

The approaches for determining the importance of features in clustering is investigated, the algorithms of initial data clustering are studied and selected, the simulation model of data generation is developed, the algorithm for determining the importance of features is developed on the basis of studied approaches, the influence of data preprocessing on the ranking of features is investigated, the method for estimating and evaluating of feature importance score is developed.

As a result of the work, the algorithm was developed for selecting the most important features of the oncogene exon, including preprocessing of data, a procedure for ranking and selecting features, and constructing an interpreted selection result. Discussion and analysis of the data were carried out, the algorithm was evaluated.
